# Book-Donation-App
An App Built using flutter using which we can share books with people around us !!

With 34% of the illiteracy rate of the world, building a book donation app is one of the great ideas on the list. With the increasing cost of education, there are underprivileged sections of the society that canâ€™t afford to buy new books for them. The NGOs and libraries can access book donation apps to collect books for the needy and may help in reducing illiteracy rate. Simple yet unique ideas like book donation apps can build up a platform where donors and receivers can connect and meet the needs of society.

### Important Features to be added
- Signup for donor and receiver
- Pickup location
- Subject or Book type (school book/university study material/magazine or novel)
- Upload the picture of book to determine the condition

## Tentative UI Design
